node_example_failing contains the current project status with the reference error.
Try reverting to the old version of node_example and running to see what the issue is.

Update: node issue was caused due to the center force being set too high (5 or greater).
Have decreased the center force but the issue still persists when the strength is increased.

Currently working on building out the filters in the left column of the page.
