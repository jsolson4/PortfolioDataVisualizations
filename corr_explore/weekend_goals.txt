0. Tooltip still appears problematic when hovering... doesn't appear to be updating

1. Add Long/short to the portfolio
2. Add long/short dropdown to the left column (make long the default)
3. add an average correlation window (upper right hand corner?)
4. add a descriptive title that changes on click
4. A) 'Average correlation of Securities within the {side} Portfolio'
4. B) 'Correlation to {selected security}'
5. Create node window
6. Move functions to javascript script file?
7. Add correlation to benchmark


NOTE: seems like there is still an issue with the tooltip...
Tooltip may just need to auto-refresh. Looks like it retains the initial value until
the hover is ended and then restarted... I'm sure this problem has been solved before.
